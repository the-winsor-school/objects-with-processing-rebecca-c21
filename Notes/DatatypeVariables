	Data Types{

	Numeric:
		whole number data types {
			int (Int32)
			short (Int16)
			long (Int64)
		}

		decimal data types {
			float
			double
			decimal
		}
	
	Raw:
		byte (8-bit): aka 8 ones and zeroes for the computer to read {
			10001000
			each power goes up bya unit 
			so this value represents 136
			there are 256 possibilities
			8 bits gives you 2 to the 8 possible values 
		}
		bool (1-bit){

		}

	//limited behaviours, used in a lot of places, but they don't do a whole lot on their own
	//we use them to contruct complex objects
	Text:

		char (character){
			secretly an integer, everything comes down to zeros 
			32 bits interpreted in a different way
		}

		string{
		} 

	Complex:
		Vector2{
			It's a numeric data type
			We attach behaviours to it 
		}

		Sprite{
		}

		Console{
			it represents the window that pops up when you open the program
			it is a new data type 
		}
	}


	//representation of it taking up space in the computer's memory 
	Memory (RAM): { //how to write down these specific things
		int x (32-bit){
		= 1248 is the maximum number of values
		this is 2 to the 23 plus 1??? 
		}

		double y{
			3.427 values 
		}

		char ch{
			'a'
		}

		string{
			"Jason"
		}
